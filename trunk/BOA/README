*****
The document is in prerelease form.

The first through third chapters on the C++ object mapping, object file
contents, and symbol table format have been
updated for Borland C++ 4.0.

The project file format chapter (chapter 4) refers specifically to
Borland C++ 3.x.

The subdirectory BC4.32 contains information on the 32 bit .OBJ and debug
formats.

The contents of the BOA.BC3 subdirectory are the utilities distributed with
the Borland C++ 3.x version of the Open Architecture Handbook.  Please note
that some of these tools are not applicable with Borland C++ 4.0.

The subdirectory DEMANGLE contains C++ demangler code (source and header) for
BC3.x.  This should apply to BC4 as well except that it will not support such
new features as operators new and delete for arrays.
